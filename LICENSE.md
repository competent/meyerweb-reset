"If you want to use my reset styles, then feel free! It's all explicitly in the public domain (I have to formally say that or else people ask me about licensing). You can grab a copy of the file to use and tweak as fits you best. If you're more of the copy-and-paste type, or just want an in-page preview of what you'll be getting, here it is."
