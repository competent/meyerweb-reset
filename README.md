# Competent meyerweb-css reset

This is an unedited copy of Eric Meyer's CSS browser reset. Things we have done:

 * packaged it in a git repo
 * copied the reset.css file to _reset.scss file to make it easier to use with sass
 * added a bower.json configuration and published it in the bower repo
 * correctly tagged the repository to make it work properly from grunt-bower

You can grab a copy of the file to use and tweak as fits you best. If you're more of the copy-and-paste type, or just want an in-page preview of what you'll be getting, here it is.
